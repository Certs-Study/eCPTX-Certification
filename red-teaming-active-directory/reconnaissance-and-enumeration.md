# âœ… Reconnaissance & Enumeration

Active Directory is a directory service by Microsoft that is commonly used by organizations to manage and organize user accounts, computer accounts, and other resources in a network.

Advanced Active Directory reconnaissance and enumeration techniques go beyond basic scanning and enumeration methods and involve in-depth analysis and exploration of the AD environment to identify potential vulnerabilities, weaknesses, or misconfigurations that can be exploited for unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

### Active Directory mapping

This involves creating a detailed map of the AD infrastructure, including the domain structure, trust relationships, organizational units (OUs), group memberships, and other AD objects. This information provides a comprehensive overview of the AD environment and helps identify potential targets for further exploitation.

### Enumeration of AD objects

This involves querying the AD environment to gather information about user accounts, groups, computers, shares, services, and other AD objects. This information can reveal details such as user account permissions, group memberships, password policies, and other configuration settings that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.

### Enumeration of AD vulnerabilities

This involves scanning the AD environment for known vulnerabilities or misconfigurations, such as weak passwords, unpatched systems, open ports, or insecure configurations in AD settings. This helps identify potential vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain unauthorized access or compromise the AD environment.

### The exploitation of AD weaknesses

This involves leveraging identified vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the AD environment to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, or bypass security controls. This may involve using techniques such as password cracking, pass-the-hash attacks, Kerberoasting, or abusing AD permissions to gain administrative access or perform unauthorized actions.

### Harvesting of AD credentials

This involves extracting or stealing credentials from the AD environment, such as user passwords, hashes, or Kerberos tickets. These credentials can be used for further exploitation, such as lateral movement within the AD environment or privilege escalation.

### Social engineering attacks

Advanced Active Directory reconnaissance and enumeration may also involve social engineering techniques to manipulate users into revealing sensitive information or performing actions that can aid in gaining unauthorized access to AD resources. This may include phishing attacks, spear-phishing, or other social engineering tactics to deceive users and extract information.

### Stealthy reconnaissance

Advanced techniques may involve using stealthy or evasive methods to avoid detection by security measures, such as using obfuscation, encryption, or other techniques to hide reconnaissance activities and avoid triggering security alerts.

It's important to note that advanced Active Directory reconnaissance and enumeration techniques are typically used for ethical hacking or security testing purposes by authorized individuals or organizations to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in their AD environment.
